# About the project:

 1. This was my lab exam for Java Programming course in Level 2 ESE on 30/11/2021.
 2. A model of a system that hold a university student records which includes how many courses the student attended, how much did they achieve in them, courses the student is currently enrolled into, etc.
 3. Each student can calculate their Grade Point Average (GPA); how this is calculated is bellow.
 4. Student can get A, B, C, D, F in any of the courses only.

# How GPA is calculated:

 1. An important value for a student is their GPA, which is computed as the average of their grades across all of their courses, weighted by the number of credits of each. In the GPA computation, the following mapping is used from letter grades to numbers: (A = 4) (B = 3) (C = 2) (D = 1) (F = 0). 
 2. GPA = the sum of the courses grade weights / number of courses

# How to use:
By running `Test.java` or by making another file and adding a main method to it then run it as an application using either:

 1. Command line:

	eg. `javac Test.java && java Test.java`

2. IDE.

# What did I learn from this:

 1. Using Enum, Maps and Sets in Java.
 3. Further improved my problem-solving and independency skills by programming and testing the full software by my own.
